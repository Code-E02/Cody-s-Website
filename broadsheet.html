                <h1 style="font-size: 50px;"><b>Creepypasta's, the rise to internet horror fiction! </b></h1>
                <h2>What are Creepypasta’s?</h2>
                <p>The word “Creepypasta” originated from the word “copypasta” which was the term on a website called
                     “4chan” an online image board. The word copypasta refers to copying and pasting a popular photo or block of text; much like 
                     sharing memes on your devices today. Where creepypastas differed from the 4chan definition was that the creepypastas were shared “scary stories” or
                     “documented blog posts” that were portrayed as non-fiction, and instead of gaining viral amounts of following surrounding funny stories or funny photos, 
                     the hype was distinguishing if these stories/legends were real.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                    Originally this was a subsection of stories on the website “4chan” where people would share stories 
                    of mythical, dark, horrifying creatures and places. As this genre grew so did the following leading to Creepypasta.com to be
                     formed in 2008. Here is where anyone could publish a page dedicated to information on these legends.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The Beggining</h2>
                    <p>The first creepy pasta was released in 2001, it was titled “Ted the Caver” and was represented as a personal blog. 
                        He would release photos of himself exploring caves and write with such extraordinary detail it was incredibly hard to distinguish if it was real or not.
                         He would update his blog every few weeks describing exploring parts of caves never seen before to humans until he was met with a hole just big enough to fit his hand,
                          he decided to start the process of chipping away at the opening to explore deeper into the cave. After the first few posts he would start to explain odd phenomena that
                           would happen while he was down in the cave, such as hearing tapping from the other side of the opening that was too small to fit through, or Animals reacting with fear
                            around the opening of the hole. This was the beginning of the genre forming.

                    <h2>The End of Creepypasta's</h2>
                    <p>The end of creepypastas came down to the exact reason it started. 
                        People enjoyed reading these stories due to their rich storytelling abilities, even making it hard to believe it's all fake.
                        Unfortunately to a select few followers of this media, there was a gap in understanding that the media surrounding it was indeed fake, causing them to take action and
                         attempt to drown out one of the legends by assaulting a classmate in the woods in an attempt to drown out one of the fictional legends.
                          This caused the creepypasta sites popularity to plummet.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>To the current day, many games and media have been made surrounding these stories.
                             This was a small part of internet history and due to that history we have gained so much media surrounding the horror industry.
