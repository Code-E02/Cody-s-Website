         My attempt at not using a screen had been an unfortunate failure.
         I had planned to not use my phone for the entirety of Sunday October 27th.
         My day started with me attempting to head to work.
         I had left for work feeling confident I would be able to make it through the day.
         </p>
         
         <p style="font-size: 35px; color: greenyellow;">
        I found myself stuck in heavy traffic on my way to work, I needed to notify my workplace I would be late so I HAD to use my phone to notify them.
         My manager had alerted me that there had been a mudslide on I5 north that had accumulated over the previous night causing the highway to be closed down for 4 exits and apparently it was explicitly announced online about the highway closure causing me to not be informed of the issue.
         I also needed my phone to reroute my drive to my workplace.
        </p>
         
         <p style="font-size: 35px; color: greenyellow;">
          Once I got to work I effectively had not been using my phone.
         I had felt a strong desire to use my phone on my lunch due to my normal routine to pass time using my phone.
         To fight this urge I decided to draw in the breakroom. Although this was helpful, I have a small attention span (possibly due to my attachment to technology) making my investment in creating creative work to be lacking.
         I also draw very fast, consisting of a lot of sketches so I found myself getting bored of a centralized activity.
        </p>
         
         <p style="font-size: 35px; color: greenyellow;">
         By the time I had left work the road closure was resolved. I then went for dinner and drinks with my girlfriend, I had not been urged to use my phone when I was with her so this portion of the day I had been consistent with not using my phone.
         Although I usually can put down my technology in social settings so this wasnâ€™t a hard task.
         At the end of the night someone in the bar we had been in had passed out aggressively, me and my girlfriend along with the bar staff had brought her back to consciousness and we had called an ambulance.
         This was a necessary use of my technology because of the medical emergency.
         In total I had failed the assignment using my phone due to a series of unfortunate events for important calls and to reroute my drives around the mudslides.
